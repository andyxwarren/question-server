        <h2>Session One: November 3, 2025</h2>
        <p>The following is a summary of all the features and fixes implemented during our first session.</p>

    <h2>UI and Visuals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selected Answer Highlighting</strong>: Updated the styling so that when a user selects a multiple-choice answer, it gets a distinct blue glow while the number remains clearly visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlined Notifications</strong>: Removed the redundant notification that used to slide in from the top, leaving only the feedback message that appears below the answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Centered Layout</strong>: Centered the main action button ("Submit/Next") for a cleaner look.</li>
        <li><strong>Number Line Rendering</strong>: Implemented a new component to render a proper visual number line for relevant questions. After many refinements, it now displays a continuous line, tick marks, and an arrow pointing to the correct answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness</strong>: Fixed the mobile layout to ensure all content, including the question and the on-screen keyboard, fits on a standard phone screen without requiring a vertical scrollbar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Button and Navigation Logic</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified "Submit/Next" Button</strong>: Merged the separate "Submit" and "Next" buttons into a single, dynamic action button. This prevents users from skipping questions, as the button only changes to "Next" after an answer has been submitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Removed Navigation Buttons</strong>: Completely removed the old "Previous" and "Next" buttons from the bottom of the screen and all associated code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keyboard Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed Keyboard Input</strong>: Resolved issues with both the on-screen and physical keyboards to ensure they reliably input numbers into the answer field.</li>
        <li><strong>Corrected Duplicate Display</strong>: Fixed a bug where the typed answer was appearing in two places at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Focus on Answer Box</strong>: The cursor is now automatically placed in the answer box for text-input questions when the question loads, allowing for immediate typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced "Enter" Key</strong>: Implemented logic so the "Enter" key on the physical keyboard acts as "Submit" when an answer is being entered, and as "Next" after the answer has been submitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Question Data Analysis & Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identified Data Issues</strong>: We analyzed questions that were not displaying correctly and determined that some issues must be fixed by the question generation team. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Converting multi-answer text questions to a multiple-choice format by adding distractor options.</li>
                <li>Adding the necessary visual data for "ten frame" questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <div id="session-2" class="session">
        <h2>Session Two: November 5, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on improving question readability, mobile responsiveness, and implementing a new hint system.</p>

        <h3>Question Formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Equation Readability</strong>: Developed a robust function to automatically detect and reformat questions containing multiple mathematical equations. The introductory text, equations, and the final question are now separated onto different lines for clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Styled Equation Blocks</strong>: Added CSS to visually group the extracted equations, making them stand out from the surrounding text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UI and Responsiveness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile Layout for Choices</strong>: Fixed the mobile layout for multiple-choice questions with four options. Instead of an awkward 3+1 arrangement, they are now displayed in a clean and symmetrical 2x2 grid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hint System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Implemented Hint Button</strong>: Replaced the automatic display of hints with a dedicated "💡 Hint" button. This button only appears if a question has an associated hint.</li>
            <li><strong>Pop-up Hints</strong>: Clicking the hint button now displays the hint in a non-intrusive pop-up notification, allowing students to try solving the question on their own first.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Hint Detection</strong>: The system now automatically detects hints from both dedicated fields in the data and those embedded directly within the question text.</li>
            <li><strong>Styled Hint Button</strong>: The hint button is styled with a distinct color to be easily identifiable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Development Workflow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolated Question Testing</strong>: Created single-question JSON files to allow for rapid testing and verification of new features without needing to navigate through the entire question set.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-3" class="session">
        <h2>Session Three: November 9, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to refining the user input experience, focusing on keyboard navigation for multiple-choice questions and improving the readability of large number inputs.</p>

        <h3>Keyboard Input Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keyboard for Multiple Choice</strong>: Enabled the use of the physical keyboard to select answers in multiple-choice questions, providing a faster alternative to mouse or touch input.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Digit Answer Logic</strong>: Implemented a sophisticated input handling system that correctly processes both single and multi-digit answers (e.g., "10"). The system intelligently waits for subsequent digits only when necessary, ensuring a responsive feel for single-digit inputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible Timing</strong>: Increased the input delay to 800ms to make the feature more accessible and comfortable for younger users who may type more slowly.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbol and Alias Support</strong>: Expanded keyboard support to include mathematical symbols (+, -, *, /) and their common keyboard aliases (e.g., using '*' for multiplication), allowing for a consistent keyboard-only experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Text Input Formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Number Formatting</strong>: Implemented a live formatting feature for text input fields. As a user types a large number, it is automatically formatted with commas as thousands separators (e.g., "12345" becomes "12,345").</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Cursor Positioning</strong>: The cursor's position is correctly maintained during formatting, allowing users to edit numbers in the middle of the input without the cursor jumping to the end.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Implementation</strong>: Fixed an issue where the formatting logic was not being applied to dynamically created input fields by using a delegated event listener, ensuring the feature works reliably across all questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question Readability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Word Problem Layout</strong>: Enhanced the question formatting logic to automatically insert a line break in word problems containing two consecutive large numbers, making them significantly easier for young learners to read and parse.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-4" class="session">
        <h2>Session Four: November 16, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on significant UI/UX improvements to the question-serving interface. The following key issues were addressed and resolved:</p>

        <h3>1. Multiple Answer Boxes for Sequence Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Questions requiring a sequence of numbers used a single, cumbersome text field.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Implemented a new `number_sequence` answer type that dynamically generates separate input boxes for each number, improving clarity and usability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Consistent Number Formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Numbers in question text (e.g., `1,371`) were formatted with commas, while numbers in answer choices (e.g., `1271`) were not, creating a visual inconsistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: A universal `formatNumber` function was created and applied to both question text and answer options, ensuring all numbers greater than 999 are consistently displayed with commas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Disabled Browser Autocomplete</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: The browser's autocomplete feature was suggesting previous answers in text input fields, which was distracting and unhelpful.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: The `autocomplete="off"` attribute was added to all text input fields, preventing the browser from remembering and suggesting previous entries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Drag-and-Drop for Number Ordering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: For questions requiring the ordering of long, complex numbers, text entry was difficult and error-prone.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: The interface was upgraded in two phases:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Improved Readability</strong>: The long string of numbers was converted into a clean, easy-to-read block of styled tags.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Ordering</strong>: A new `drag_and_drop_order` answer type was introduced, which replaces the text field with a fully interactive drag-and-drop list, powered by `SortableJS`.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-5" class="session">
        <h2>Session Five: November 17, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to refining the presentation of questions, focusing on clarity, consistency, and usability.</p>

        <h3>Question Formatting and Layout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Removed Scrollbars</strong>: Eliminated unnecessary scrollbars from the question text area by removing restrictive `max-height` properties, ensuring that all question content is fully visible by default.</li>
            <li><strong>Labeled Equation Options</strong>: For multiple-choice questions that refer to a list of equations, the system now automatically labels each equation (A, B, C, D) to correspond with the answer choices, significantly improving clarity. Legacy hardcoded labels are also automatically removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Labeled Input Boxes</strong>: For questions requiring multi-part answers (e.g., tens and ones), the input boxes are now clearly labeled. The system extracts these labels from the question text and displays them directly above each box.</li>
            <li><strong>Boxed Numbers in Text</strong>: To avoid confusion between thousands separators and grammatical commas, numbers that appear in introductory phrases (e.g., "In 2,834, what does...") are now displayed in a distinct, styled box, and the trailing comma is removed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Input Consistency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Multi-Box Input</strong>: The application now automatically detects any question with a comma-separated answer and renders the user-friendly multi-box input interface, ensuring a consistent experience for all multi-part questions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-6" class="session">
        <h2>Session Six: November 21, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to implementing a robust, real-time user adventure logging system and resolving all outstanding version control issues.</p>

        <h3>Live User Adventure Logging</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File System Access API</strong>: Implemented a modern, secure logging system using the File System Access API. This allows the application to write directly to a local file with the user's explicit permission.</li>
            <li><strong>"Enable Live Logging" Workflow</strong>: Added an "Enable Live Logging" button that prompts the user to select the `user_adventure.csv` file, granting the application persistent read/write access for the session.</li>
            <li><strong>"Save & End" Button</strong>: Introduced a "Save & End" button, allowing users to gracefully exit a question batch at any time. This action writes all queued log data to the file before showing the results screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous File Writing</strong>: Refined the file-writing process to be fully asynchronous and decoupled from UI updates. This fixed a critical bug where the Live Server would cause a page refresh by detecting file changes during a question transition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Version Control and Workflow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Git Configuration</strong>: Diagnosed and resolved a `git commit` failure by guiding the user to set their global Git user name and email address.</li>
            <li><strong>Successful Push to Remote</strong>: After configuring the user's Git identity, all pending changes were successfully committed and pushed to the remote repository, ensuring the project is fully up to date.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-7" class="session">
        <h2>Session Seven: November 24, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to a major architectural evolution: integrating the <strong>Pathway Selector</strong> as the main entry point and building a sophisticated, multi-layered user progression system.</p>

        <h3>Pathway Selector Integration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Seamless Navigation</strong>: The <code>Pathway_Selector.html</code> page is now fully integrated. Clicking a mission button (e.g., "Counting") seamlessly redirects the user to the main quiz application.</li>
            <li><strong>URL-Based Mission Loading</strong>: The chosen mission is passed to the main application via a URL parameter (e.g., <code>index.html?mission=Counting</code>), allowing for automatic, targeted quiz sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Quiz Start</strong>: The application now detects the mission parameter on load, automatically filters the question pool, and starts the quiz immediately, bypassing all manual setup screens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mastery-Based Progression System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Layered Progression</strong>: Implemented a robust progression engine that guides users through a structured learning path, first by <strong>School Year (Level)</strong> and then by <strong>Pundex (Difficulty Tier)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>"7 out of 10" Mastery Rule</strong>: Users must now answer at least 7 of their last 10 questions correctly to master a Pundex tier before the system automatically advances them.</li>
            <li><strong>Gamified Pundex Tiers</strong>: Replaced the internal difficulty names with more engaging, gamified names: <strong>Ignition</strong>, <strong>Charging</strong>, <strong>Ready</strong>, and <strong>Power Up</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UI and Visual Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Power Meter</strong>: The old text-based tags were replaced with a dynamic, visual "Power Meter" that clearly displays the user's progression through the Pundex tiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual State Feedback</strong>: The Power Meter provides clear visual cues for the user's status:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Glowing</strong>: The current Pundex tier has a subtle, pulsing glow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solid</strong>: Mastered Pundex tiers are displayed in a solid color.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: Future, un-started tiers are visible but faded.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custom Color Scheme</strong>: Applied a custom red, yellow, green, and purple color scheme to the Power Meter, inspired by the user's UI model.</li>
            <li><strong>Unified Header Display</strong>: Consolidated all key information (CDR Code, Mission Name, and Level) into a clean, unified block of tags above the Power Meter.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-8" class="session">
        <h2>Session Eight: December 7, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on fixing the Pathway Selector integration, improving the progression system, converting question data formats, and significantly overhauling the UI layout.</p>

        <h3>Pathway Selector Button Activation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic CSV Matching (Initial Approach)</strong>: Attempted to dynamically enable mission buttons based on matching mission names from <code>Existing Missions.csv</code>. This involved building a robust CSV parser and flexible text normalization (handling &amp; vs AND, line breaks, punctuation differences).</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Button Activation</strong>: Due to persistent matching issues with the temporary CSV file, switched to manually activating three specific mission buttons: "Identifying, Representing &amp; Estimating", "Multiplication &amp; Division Facts", and "Equations". This involved adding <code>onclick</code> handlers and removing the <code>disabled</code> class and greyed-out styling.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Click Listener Fix</strong>: Fixed an issue where manually activated buttons were still showing a "Mission Coming Soon" popup. The global <code>document.addEventListener('click', ...)</code> was modified to check <code>btn.hasAttribute('onclick')</code> and skip buttons that have their own click handlers.</li>
            <li><strong>Button Styling</strong>: Ensured manually activated buttons have full opacity and a pointer cursor, overriding the default greyed-out appearance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mission Loading Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSV Parsing Fix</strong>: Fixed the mission loading in <code>app.js</code> by implementing a robust CSV parser that correctly handles quoted fields containing commas. This resolved the "Could not load the selected mission" error.</li>
            <li><strong>Question Pool Initialization</strong>: Added the missing <code>setQuestionPool()</code> call before <code>startQuestions()</code> in the auto-load function, fixing the "No questions selected" error.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question Data Analysis & Conversion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Count Analysis</strong>: Analyzed all JSON files in the "Already Tested by Ads" folder and discovered a critical mismatch: each Year + Pundex combination only had 5 questions, but the mastery system requires 10 questions for the 7-out-of-10 rule.</li>
            <li><strong>CSV to JSON Converter</strong>: Built a converter to transform <code>1N1a (Ads Counting Qs).csv</code> into a compatible JSON format with 100 questions (25 per Pundex tier), all for Year 1. This provides sufficient questions for the mastery system.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Mission Mapping</strong>: Updated <code>Existing Missions.csv</code> to point the Counting mission to the new JSON file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progression System Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Mastery Detection</strong>: Modified the progression logic so that during the first 10 questions, users level up immediately upon getting 7 correct (could be after question 7, 8, 9, or 10). After 10 questions, the rolling window logic applies.</li>
            <li><strong>World & Realm from CSV</strong>: The application now extracts and stores World and Realm information from the CSV when loading a mission, enabling richer metadata display.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual Progress Bar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>10-Box Progress Indicator</strong>: Replaced the text-based progress counter with a visual 10-box horizontal bar. Boxes turn green for correct answers and red for incorrect answers.</li>
            <li><strong>Question Numbers</strong>: Added small question numbers underneath each box that update as the user progresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling Window Display</strong>: After 10 questions, the boxes and numbers shift left to show the rolling window of the last 10 answers, with the rightmost box white for the next unanswered question.</li>
            <li><strong>Deferred Shift</strong>: The window only shifts when clicking "Next" to move to a new question, not immediately upon answering.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling Score Display</strong>: The "Rolling Score" counter only appears after moving to question 11, not when answering question 10.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UI Layout Overhaul</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unified Info Bar</strong>: Combined World, Realm, Mission, and Level into a single purple bar above the Power Meter (e.g., "NUMBER > PLACE VALUE > COUNTING > LEVEL 1").</li>
            <li><strong>Removed Metadata Tags</strong>: Removed the separate module ID and mission tags that were previously displayed.</li>
            <li><strong>Repositioned Progress Status</strong>: Moved the 10-box progress bar and score counters below the Power Meter.</li>
            <li><strong>Compact Top Row</strong>: Reorganized the top row to include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q Counter</strong>: Green box showing "Q 1 of 25" (shortened from "Question").</li>
                    <li><strong>Save & End</strong>: Centered button matching the Hint button height.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hint</strong>: Right-aligned hint button.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Button Styling</strong>: All top-row buttons now have matching heights and padding.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-9" class="session">
        <h2>Session Nine: December 9-10, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on building a comprehensive Progress Dashboard and enhancing the mission loading system with level support.</p>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard Creation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New Dashboard Page</strong>: Created <code>Progress_Dashboard.html</code>, a visual overview showing student mastery across all Worlds, Realms, and Missions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Table Structure</strong>: Built a table displaying all 45 missions organized by World (Number, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry, Ratio, Statistics) and Realm, with 6 Level columns.</li>
            <li><strong>Pundex Progress Indicators</strong>: Each mission/level cell displays 4 small colored boxes representing the Pundex tiers (Ignition, Charging, Ready, Power Up), with completed tiers shown in solid color.</li>
            <li><strong>Sticky Headers</strong>: Implemented sticky column headers that remain visible when scrolling through the table.</li>
            <li><strong>Column Width Optimization</strong>: Adjusted the first column width to 340px to accommodate long mission names like "Interpreting, Constructing & Presenting Data".</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unavailable Level Indicators</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Module Detection</strong>: Read the <code>Mission Summary.xlsx</code> spreadsheet to identify which mission/level combinations have zero modules.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Obscuring</strong>: Created an <code>unavailable</code> CSS class that greys out cells and displays a "—" dash where no modules exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Applied to All Missions</strong>: Systematically updated all 45 mission rows to mark unavailable levels based on the spreadsheet data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Module Tooltips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hover Tooltips</strong>: Added tooltips that appear when hovering over any mission/level cell, displaying the module descriptions from <code>topic_rows Nov25 to map to Andy's CDR.csv</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Positioning</strong>: Implemented smart tooltip positioning that shows above the cell normally, but below the cell when near the top of the viewport.</li>
            <li><strong>Left-Justified Text</strong>: Styled tooltips with left-aligned text and width matching the column for better readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Cursor Behavior</strong>: Pointer cursor only appears on "current level" cells (where student is actively working), not on completed or future levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Launch Functionality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clickable Current Level</strong>: The cell representing the student's current level (in progress or next to start) is clickable and navigates to the quiz.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Buttons</strong>: Added a "Launch" button right-justified in each mission row that loads the quiz at the current level for that mission.</li>
            <li><strong>URL Level Parameter</strong>: Extended <code>app.js</code> to accept a <code>level</code> URL parameter (e.g., <code>index.html?mission=Counting&level=2</code>), allowing direct navigation to specific levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legend Updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reordered Legend</strong>: Moved "Not Started" to the left side of the legend for logical progression.</li>
            <li><strong>No Modules Indicator</strong>: Added a "No Modules" legend item showing the grey dash style used for unavailable levels.</li>
        </ul>
