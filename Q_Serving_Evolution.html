    <div id="session-1" class="session">
        <h2>Session One: November 3, 2025</h2>
        <p>The following is a summary of all the features and fixes implemented during our first session.</p>

    <h2>UI and Visuals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selected Answer Highlighting</strong>: Updated the styling so that when a user selects a multiple-choice answer, it gets a distinct blue glow while the number remains clearly visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlined Notifications</strong>: Removed the redundant notification that used to slide in from the top, leaving only the feedback message that appears below the answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Centered Layout</strong>: Centered the main action button ("Submit/Next") for a cleaner look.</li>
        <li><strong>Number Line Rendering</strong>: Implemented a new component to render a proper visual number line for relevant questions. After many refinements, it now displays a continuous line, tick marks, and an arrow pointing to the correct answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Responsiveness</strong>: Fixed the mobile layout to ensure all content, including the question and the on-screen keyboard, fits on a standard phone screen without requiring a vertical scrollbar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Button and Navigation Logic</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified "Submit/Next" Button</strong>: Merged the separate "Submit" and "Next" buttons into a single, dynamic action button. This prevents users from skipping questions, as the button only changes to "Next" after an answer has been submitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Removed Navigation Buttons</strong>: Completely removed the old "Previous" and "Next" buttons from the bottom of the screen and all associated code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keyboard Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed Keyboard Input</strong>: Resolved issues with both the on-screen and physical keyboards to ensure they reliably input numbers into the answer field.</li>
        <li><strong>Corrected Duplicate Display</strong>: Fixed a bug where the typed answer was appearing in two places at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Focus on Answer Box</strong>: The cursor is now automatically placed in the answer box for text-input questions when the question loads, allowing for immediate typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced "Enter" Key</strong>: Implemented logic so the "Enter" key on the physical keyboard acts as "Submit" when an answer is being entered, and as "Next" after the answer has been submitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Question Data Analysis & Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identified Data Issues</strong>: We analyzed questions that were not displaying correctly and determined that some issues must be fixed by the question generation team. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Converting multi-answer text questions to a multiple-choice format by adding distractor options.</li>
                <li>Adding the necessary visual data for "ten frame" questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <div id="session-2" class="session">
        <h2>Session Two: November 5, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on improving question readability, mobile responsiveness, and implementing a new hint system.</p>

        <h3>Question Formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Equation Readability</strong>: Developed a robust function to automatically detect and reformat questions containing multiple mathematical equations. The introductory text, equations, and the final question are now separated onto different lines for clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Styled Equation Blocks</strong>: Added CSS to visually group the extracted equations, making them stand out from the surrounding text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UI and Responsiveness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile Layout for Choices</strong>: Fixed the mobile layout for multiple-choice questions with four options. Instead of an awkward 3+1 arrangement, they are now displayed in a clean and symmetrical 2x2 grid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hint System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Implemented Hint Button</strong>: Replaced the automatic display of hints with a dedicated "💡 Hint" button. This button only appears if a question has an associated hint.</li>
            <li><strong>Pop-up Hints</strong>: Clicking the hint button now displays the hint in a non-intrusive pop-up notification, allowing students to try solving the question on their own first.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Hint Detection</strong>: The system now automatically detects hints from both dedicated fields in the data and those embedded directly within the question text.</li>
            <li><strong>Styled Hint Button</strong>: The hint button is styled with a distinct color to be easily identifiable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Development Workflow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolated Question Testing</strong>: Created single-question JSON files to allow for rapid testing and verification of new features without needing to navigate through the entire question set.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-3" class="session">
        <h2>Session Three: November 9, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to refining the user input experience, focusing on keyboard navigation for multiple-choice questions and improving the readability of large number inputs.</p>

        <h3>Keyboard Input Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keyboard for Multiple Choice</strong>: Enabled the use of the physical keyboard to select answers in multiple-choice questions, providing a faster alternative to mouse or touch input.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Digit Answer Logic</strong>: Implemented a sophisticated input handling system that correctly processes both single and multi-digit answers (e.g., "10"). The system intelligently waits for subsequent digits only when necessary, ensuring a responsive feel for single-digit inputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible Timing</strong>: Increased the input delay to 800ms to make the feature more accessible and comfortable for younger users who may type more slowly.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbol and Alias Support</strong>: Expanded keyboard support to include mathematical symbols (+, -, *, /) and their common keyboard aliases (e.g., using '*' for multiplication), allowing for a consistent keyboard-only experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Text Input Formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Number Formatting</strong>: Implemented a live formatting feature for text input fields. As a user types a large number, it is automatically formatted with commas as thousands separators (e.g., "12345" becomes "12,345").</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Cursor Positioning</strong>: The cursor's position is correctly maintained during formatting, allowing users to edit numbers in the middle of the input without the cursor jumping to the end.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Implementation</strong>: Fixed an issue where the formatting logic was not being applied to dynamically created input fields by using a delegated event listener, ensuring the feature works reliably across all questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question Readability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Word Problem Layout</strong>: Enhanced the question formatting logic to automatically insert a line break in word problems containing two consecutive large numbers, making them significantly easier for young learners to read and parse.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-4" class="session">
        <h2>Session Four: November 16, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on significant UI/UX improvements to the question-serving interface. The following key issues were addressed and resolved:</p>

        <h3>1. Multiple Answer Boxes for Sequence Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Questions requiring a sequence of numbers used a single, cumbersome text field.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Implemented a new `number_sequence` answer type that dynamically generates separate input boxes for each number, improving clarity and usability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Consistent Number Formatting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Numbers in question text (e.g., `1,371`) were formatted with commas, while numbers in answer choices (e.g., `1271`) were not, creating a visual inconsistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: A universal `formatNumber` function was created and applied to both question text and answer options, ensuring all numbers greater than 999 are consistently displayed with commas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Disabled Browser Autocomplete</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: The browser's autocomplete feature was suggesting previous answers in text input fields, which was distracting and unhelpful.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: The `autocomplete="off"` attribute was added to all text input fields, preventing the browser from remembering and suggesting previous entries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Drag-and-Drop for Number Ordering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: For questions requiring the ordering of long, complex numbers, text entry was difficult and error-prone.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: The interface was upgraded in two phases:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Improved Readability</strong>: The long string of numbers was converted into a clean, easy-to-read block of styled tags.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Ordering</strong>: A new `drag_and_drop_order` answer type was introduced, which replaces the text field with a fully interactive drag-and-drop list, powered by `SortableJS`.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-5" class="session">
        <h2>Session Five: November 17, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to refining the presentation of questions, focusing on clarity, consistency, and usability.</p>

        <h3>Question Formatting and Layout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Removed Scrollbars</strong>: Eliminated unnecessary scrollbars from the question text area by removing restrictive `max-height` properties, ensuring that all question content is fully visible by default.</li>
            <li><strong>Labeled Equation Options</strong>: For multiple-choice questions that refer to a list of equations, the system now automatically labels each equation (A, B, C, D) to correspond with the answer choices, significantly improving clarity. Legacy hardcoded labels are also automatically removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Labeled Input Boxes</strong>: For questions requiring multi-part answers (e.g., tens and ones), the input boxes are now clearly labeled. The system extracts these labels from the question text and displays them directly above each box.</li>
            <li><strong>Boxed Numbers in Text</strong>: To avoid confusion between thousands separators and grammatical commas, numbers that appear in introductory phrases (e.g., "In 2,834, what does...") are now displayed in a distinct, styled box, and the trailing comma is removed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Input Consistency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Multi-Box Input</strong>: The application now automatically detects any question with a comma-separated answer and renders the user-friendly multi-box input interface, ensuring a consistent experience for all multi-part questions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-6" class="session">
        <h2>Session Six: November 21, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to implementing a robust, real-time user adventure logging system and resolving all outstanding version control issues.</p>

        <h3>Live User Adventure Logging</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File System Access API</strong>: Implemented a modern, secure logging system using the File System Access API. This allows the application to write directly to a local file with the user's explicit permission.</li>
            <li><strong>"Enable Live Logging" Workflow</strong>: Added an "Enable Live Logging" button that prompts the user to select the `user_adventure.csv` file, granting the application persistent read/write access for the session.</li>
            <li><strong>"Save & End" Button</strong>: Introduced a "Save & End" button, allowing users to gracefully exit a question batch at any time. This action writes all queued log data to the file before showing the results screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous File Writing</strong>: Refined the file-writing process to be fully asynchronous and decoupled from UI updates. This fixed a critical bug where the Live Server would cause a page refresh by detecting file changes during a question transition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Version Control and Workflow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Git Configuration</strong>: Diagnosed and resolved a `git commit` failure by guiding the user to set their global Git user name and email address.</li>
            <li><strong>Successful Push to Remote</strong>: After configuring the user's Git identity, all pending changes were successfully committed and pushed to the remote repository, ensuring the project is fully up to date.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-7" class="session">
        <h2>Session Seven: November 24, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session was dedicated to a major architectural evolution: integrating the <strong>Pathway Selector</strong> as the main entry point and building a sophisticated, multi-layered user progression system.</p>

        <h3>Pathway Selector Integration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Seamless Navigation</strong>: The <code>Pathway_Selector.html</code> page is now fully integrated. Clicking a mission button (e.g., "Counting") seamlessly redirects the user to the main quiz application.</li>
            <li><strong>URL-Based Mission Loading</strong>: The chosen mission is passed to the main application via a URL parameter (e.g., <code>index.html?mission=Counting</code>), allowing for automatic, targeted quiz sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Quiz Start</strong>: The application now detects the mission parameter on load, automatically filters the question pool, and starts the quiz immediately, bypassing all manual setup screens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mastery-Based Progression System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Layered Progression</strong>: Implemented a robust progression engine that guides users through a structured learning path, first by <strong>School Year (Level)</strong> and then by <strong>Pundex (Difficulty Tier)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>"7 out of 10" Mastery Rule</strong>: Users must now answer at least 7 of their last 10 questions correctly to master a Pundex tier before the system automatically advances them.</li>
            <li><strong>Gamified Pundex Tiers</strong>: Replaced the internal difficulty names with more engaging, gamified names: <strong>Ignition</strong>, <strong>Charging</strong>, <strong>Ready</strong>, and <strong>Power Up</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UI and Visual Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Power Meter</strong>: The old text-based tags were replaced with a dynamic, visual "Power Meter" that clearly displays the user's progression through the Pundex tiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual State Feedback</strong>: The Power Meter provides clear visual cues for the user's status:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Glowing</strong>: The current Pundex tier has a subtle, pulsing glow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solid</strong>: Mastered Pundex tiers are displayed in a solid color.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: Future, un-started tiers are visible but faded.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custom Color Scheme</strong>: Applied a custom red, yellow, green, and purple color scheme to the Power Meter, inspired by the user's UI model.</li>
            <li><strong>Unified Header Display</strong>: Consolidated all key information (CDR Code, Mission Name, and Level) into a clean, unified block of tags above the Power Meter.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-8" class="session">
        <h2>Session Eight: December 7, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on fixing the Pathway Selector integration, improving the progression system, converting question data formats, and significantly overhauling the UI layout.</p>

        <h3>Pathway Selector Button Activation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic CSV Matching (Initial Approach)</strong>: Attempted to dynamically enable mission buttons based on matching mission names from <code>Existing Missions.csv</code>. This involved building a robust CSV parser and flexible text normalization (handling &amp; vs AND, line breaks, punctuation differences).</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Button Activation</strong>: Due to persistent matching issues with the temporary CSV file, switched to manually activating three specific mission buttons: "Identifying, Representing &amp; Estimating", "Multiplication &amp; Division Facts", and "Equations". This involved adding <code>onclick</code> handlers and removing the <code>disabled</code> class and greyed-out styling.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Click Listener Fix</strong>: Fixed an issue where manually activated buttons were still showing a "Mission Coming Soon" popup. The global <code>document.addEventListener('click', ...)</code> was modified to check <code>btn.hasAttribute('onclick')</code> and skip buttons that have their own click handlers.</li>
            <li><strong>Button Styling</strong>: Ensured manually activated buttons have full opacity and a pointer cursor, overriding the default greyed-out appearance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mission Loading Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSV Parsing Fix</strong>: Fixed the mission loading in <code>app.js</code> by implementing a robust CSV parser that correctly handles quoted fields containing commas. This resolved the "Could not load the selected mission" error.</li>
            <li><strong>Question Pool Initialization</strong>: Added the missing <code>setQuestionPool()</code> call before <code>startQuestions()</code> in the auto-load function, fixing the "No questions selected" error.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question Data Analysis & Conversion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Count Analysis</strong>: Analyzed all JSON files in the "Already Tested by Ads" folder and discovered a critical mismatch: each Year + Pundex combination only had 5 questions, but the mastery system requires 10 questions for the 7-out-of-10 rule.</li>
            <li><strong>CSV to JSON Converter</strong>: Built a converter to transform <code>1N1a (Ads Counting Qs).csv</code> into a compatible JSON format with 100 questions (25 per Pundex tier), all for Year 1. This provides sufficient questions for the mastery system.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Mission Mapping</strong>: Updated <code>Existing Missions.csv</code> to point the Counting mission to the new JSON file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progression System Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Mastery Detection</strong>: Modified the progression logic so that during the first 10 questions, users level up immediately upon getting 7 correct (could be after question 7, 8, 9, or 10). After 10 questions, the rolling window logic applies.</li>
            <li><strong>World & Realm from CSV</strong>: The application now extracts and stores World and Realm information from the CSV when loading a mission, enabling richer metadata display.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual Progress Bar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>10-Box Progress Indicator</strong>: Replaced the text-based progress counter with a visual 10-box horizontal bar. Boxes turn green for correct answers and red for incorrect answers.</li>
            <li><strong>Question Numbers</strong>: Added small question numbers underneath each box that update as the user progresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling Window Display</strong>: After 10 questions, the boxes and numbers shift left to show the rolling window of the last 10 answers, with the rightmost box white for the next unanswered question.</li>
            <li><strong>Deferred Shift</strong>: The window only shifts when clicking "Next" to move to a new question, not immediately upon answering.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling Score Display</strong>: The "Rolling Score" counter only appears after moving to question 11, not when answering question 10.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UI Layout Overhaul</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unified Info Bar</strong>: Combined World, Realm, Mission, and Level into a single purple bar above the Power Meter (e.g., "NUMBER > PLACE VALUE > COUNTING > LEVEL 1").</li>
            <li><strong>Removed Metadata Tags</strong>: Removed the separate module ID and mission tags that were previously displayed.</li>
            <li><strong>Repositioned Progress Status</strong>: Moved the 10-box progress bar and score counters below the Power Meter.</li>
            <li><strong>Compact Top Row</strong>: Reorganized the top row to include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q Counter</strong>: Green box showing "Q 1 of 25" (shortened from "Question").</li>
                    <li><strong>Save & End</strong>: Centered button matching the Hint button height.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hint</strong>: Right-aligned hint button.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Button Styling</strong>: All top-row buttons now have matching heights and padding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Session Nine: December 9-10, 2025</h2>
        <p>This session focused on building a comprehensive Progress Dashboard and enhancing the mission loading system with level support.</p>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard Creation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New Dashboard Page</strong>: Created <code>Progress_Dashboard.html</code>, a visual overview showing student mastery across all Worlds, Realms, and Missions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Table Structure</strong>: Built a table displaying all 45 missions organized by World (Number, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry, Ratio, Statistics) and Realm, with 6 Level columns.</li>
            <li><strong>Pundex Progress Indicators</strong>: Each mission/level cell displays 4 small colored boxes representing the Pundex tiers (Ignition, Charging, Ready, Power Up), with completed tiers shown in solid color.</li>
            <li><strong>Sticky Headers</strong>: Implemented sticky column headers that remain visible when scrolling through the table.</li>
            <li><strong>Column Width Optimization</strong>: Adjusted the first column width to 340px to accommodate long mission names like "Interpreting, Constructing & Presenting Data".</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unavailable Level Indicators</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Module Detection</strong>: Read the <code>Mission Summary.xlsx</code> spreadsheet to identify which mission/level combinations have zero modules.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Obscuring</strong>: Created an <code>unavailable</code> CSS class that greys out cells and displays a "—" dash where no modules exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Applied to All Missions</strong>: Systematically updated all 45 mission rows to mark unavailable levels based on the spreadsheet data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Module Tooltips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hover Tooltips</strong>: Added tooltips that appear when hovering over any mission/level cell, displaying the module descriptions from <code>topic_rows Nov25 to map to Andy's CDR.csv</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Positioning</strong>: Implemented smart tooltip positioning that shows above the cell normally, but below the cell when near the top of the viewport.</li>
            <li><strong>Left-Justified Text</strong>: Styled tooltips with left-aligned text and width matching the column for better readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Cursor Behavior</strong>: Pointer cursor only appears on "current level" cells (where student is actively working), not on completed or future levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Launch Functionality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clickable Current Level</strong>: The cell representing the student's current level (in progress or next to start) is clickable and navigates to the quiz.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Buttons</strong>: Added a "Launch" button right-justified in each mission row that loads the quiz at the current level for that mission.</li>
            <li><strong>URL Level Parameter</strong>: Extended <code>app.js</code> to accept a <code>level</code> URL parameter (e.g., <code>index.html?mission=Counting&level=2</code>), allowing direct navigation to specific levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legend Updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reordered Legend</strong>: Moved "Not Started" to the left side of the legend for logical progression.</li>
            <li><strong>No Modules Indicator</strong>: Added a "No Modules" legend item showing the grey dash style used for unavailable levels.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-10" class="session">
        <h2>Session Ten: December 12, 2025</h2>
        <p>Major mobile layout refinements for the question practice interface (index.html).</p>

        <h3>User Panel Replacement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compact Hamburger Menu</strong>: Replaced the verbose user panel with a compact avatar circle and hamburger menu button containing user info, Progress, Change Mission, and Logout options.</li>
            <li><strong>Inline Header Integration</strong>: Added a second user header inside the question-header grid (<code>#header-user-menu</code>) so it appears inline with the level indicator during questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed Header Hidden</strong>: The fixed position user header is now hidden when the question section is active, replaced by the inline version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Responsive Level Indicator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full/Short Versions</strong>: Level indicator now contains both full path (World > Realm > Mission > Level) and short version (Mission L#) wrapped in spans with classes <code>.level-full</code> and <code>.level-short</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Display</strong>: On phone, only the short version displays to save horizontal space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mobile-Specific Simplifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active Pundex Only</strong>: Initially showed only the active/flashing pundex indicator on mobile (later changed to show all four as small circles).</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Toggle Hidden</strong>: Hidden the keyboard toggle button on phone since the on-screen keyboard is always visible.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Padding</strong>: Tightened header gaps and padding on mobile for more compact display.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hamburger Menu Enhancements</h3>

                    <li>Row 1: Mission indicator (stretches) + Avatar/Menu button</li>
                    <li>Row 2: Pundex indicator (left) + Hint button (right)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Abbreviated Pundex Indicators</strong>: On mobile, all four pundex indicators display as small circles with abbreviated text (I, C, R, PU) instead of hiding inactive ones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progress Display on Mobile</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full-Width Score Boxes</strong>: The 10-box progress indicator now stretches to fill the full screen width on mobile.</li>

            <li><strong>Score Boxes on Third Row</strong>: Moved the progress boxes to their own row below the pundex/hint row.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tablet and Laptop Layout Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistent Grid Layout</strong>: Applied same header grid structure to both tablet and laptop views:
                <ul>
                    <li>Row 1: Level indicator + Keyboard toggle + Avatar/Menu</li>
                    <li>Row 2: Pundex/Progress (centered) + Hint button (right)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Toggle Positioning</strong>: Moved keyboard toggle button to top row near hamburger menu for easier access.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Vertical Gap</strong>: Tightened spacing between header rows and question content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Code Improvements</h3>

            <li><strong>Display Contents</strong>: Used CSS <code>display: contents</code> on header-center-group to flatten the DOM for better flex alignment on mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Elements</strong>: Used <code>position: absolute</code> on hidden elements (#progress-indicator, #session-controls, #question-metadata) to remove them from grid flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On-Screen Keyboard Visibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Keyboard Visible</strong>: Fixed mobile layout to ensure the on-screen keyboard is fully visible without being cut off at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li><strong>No Scrolling Required</strong>: Eliminated vertical scrolling on mobile - all content (question, answer input, keyboard) fits within the viewport.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Left/Right Handed Mode</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Setup Option</strong>: Added left-handed/right-handed preference selection during account creation in <code>login.html</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Positioning</strong>: On tablet, the on-screen keyboard appears on the left or right side based on the user's handedness preference.</li>
            <li><strong>Stored in User Profile</strong>: Handedness preference is saved with the user account and applied automatically on login.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Autofill Clearing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Autofill Data</strong>: Added functionality to clear browser autofill suggestions from form fields to prevent interference with the login process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Power Up and Level Up Animations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Up Animation</strong>: Created a celebratory overlay animation that plays when completing all four Pundex tiers (Ignition → Charging → Ready → Power Up), showing the meter filling and flashing.</li>
            <li><strong>Level Up Animation</strong>: Added a distinct animation when advancing to the next level after completing Power Up, with visual feedback showing progression.</li>
            <li><strong>Sequenced Effects</strong>: Animations use timed sequences with CSS transitions to show lights filling, flashing, and the overlay fading out.</li>

            <li><strong>Header Positioning</strong>: Set header bar to <code>position: fixed</code> at <code>top: 80px</code> with <code>z-index: 500</code> to stay visible during scrolling.</li>
            <li><strong>Column Width Alignment</strong>: Configured header cells with explicit widths (40% for Mission, 20% for each level) to match table column widths.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard - Mobile Column Visibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hide Extra Columns</strong>: Used <code>nth-child(n+5)</code> selector to hide Level 4, 5, 6 columns (columns 5-7) on mobile with <code>display: none</code>, <code>width: 0</code>, and <code>visibility: collapse</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Colgroup Control</strong>: Applied column widths via <code>colgroup col</code> selectors for consistent table layout with <code>table-layout: fixed</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Realm Row Columns</strong>: Ensured realm rows also hide columns 5+ and display columns 2-4 with proper widths.</li>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard - Sticky Elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Realm Row Positioning</strong>: Set realm rows to <code>position: sticky</code> at <code>top: 110px</code> to stick below the fixed header bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Dashboard Container Padding</strong>: Added <code>padding-top: 30px</code> to account for the fixed header height.</li>
            <li><strong>Z-Index Layering</strong>: Configured proper z-index values (500 for header bar, 50 for realm rows) to ensure correct stacking order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pathway Selector - Laptop View (No Scrolling)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Container Sizing</strong>: Reduced container margin to <code>2vh</code>, padding to <code>15px</code>, and set <code>overflow-y: hidden</code> to prevent scrolling.</li>
            <li><strong>Smaller Arcade Buttons</strong>: Reduced button size from 155px to 130px (width/height) and font-size to 0.9em.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Grid Gap</strong>: Changed grid gap from <code>32px 24px</code> to <code>20px 20px</code> for tighter button spacing.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard - Hierarchical Mission Unlocking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prerequisite Logic</strong>: Implemented hierarchical unlocking where missions starting at Level N only appear after all missions at levels below N are completed to Power Up.</li>
            <li><strong>Level Completion Check</strong>: Added <code>isLevelFullyCompleted()</code> function to verify all missions at a given level have Power Up status.</li>
            <li><strong>Locked Mission Styling</strong>: Created <code>.locked-mission</code> CSS class to hide missions that haven't met prerequisites (<code>display: none</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Availability</strong>: Missions dynamically appear as users complete prerequisite levels, encouraging systematic progression.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard - Curriculum-Based Level Availability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Available Levels Data</strong>: Added <code>availableLevels</code> object mapping each CDR to its available year levels based on <code>topic_rows.csv</code> curriculum data.</li>
            <li><strong>Unavailable Level Marking</strong>: <code>markUnavailableLevels()</code> function marks cells as unavailable if not in curriculum (shows dash "—").</li>
            <li><strong>14 Level 1 Missions</strong>: Verified exactly 14 missions are available at Level 1, matching curriculum structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Session Thirteen: December 19-20, 2025</h2>
        <p>Comprehensive mobile layout refinements for Pathway Selector and Progress Dashboard, plus Power Up overlay improvements.</p>

        <h3>Pathway Selector - Mobile Layout Overhaul</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centered Neon Frame</strong>: Fixed mobile container positioning using <code>left: 50%</code>, <code>transform: translateX(-50%)</code>, and <code>width: min(calc(100vw - 20px), 420px)</code> to center the green border perfectly on all screen widths.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Column Button Grid</strong>: Converted mobile button layout to CSS Grid with <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)</code> and <code>place-items: center</code> for symmetrical button placement.</li>
            <li><strong>Button Sizing</strong>: Standardized mobile buttons at 130px diameter with 0.65em font-size, including FDP world missions which previously used smaller 95px buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Vertical Spacing</strong>: Implemented <code>padding-top: 110px</code> with negative top margin to create thin strip below title while keeping buttons below sticky header.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Wrapping</strong>: Removed <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code> and <code>white-space: nowrap</code>, allowing button labels to wrap naturally across multiple lines with <code>word-break: break-word</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Breadcrumb Alignment</strong>: Added <code>margin-top: -6px</code> to breadcrumb buttons so "Worlds" button aligns vertically with hamburger menu without moving green divider line.</li>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard - Mobile Flickering Fix</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sticky Header Opacity</strong>: Applied Google/Gemini's fix to eliminate column border flickering during scroll by matching header border color to background (<code>#667eea</code>) and adding <code>background-clip: padding-box</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Mission Row Backgrounds</strong>: Set explicit white backgrounds (<code>#ffffff</code>) on mission row cells with <code>#dddddd</code> borders to prevent content bleeding through.</li>
            <li><strong>World Row Outline</strong>: Added <code>outline: 1px solid #e8eaf6</code> to sticky world rows to mask rendering artifacts during GPU compositing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Power Up Overlay - Mobile Diagonal Layout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute Positioning</strong>: Rebuilt mobile Power Up overlay using <code>position: absolute</code> within a fixed-height container (130px) instead of flexbox with transforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagonal Arrangement</strong>: Positioned four pundex lights along a bottom-left to top-right diagonal using calculated left/bottom positions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Light 1: <code>left: 0; bottom: 0</code></li>
                    <li>Light 2: <code>left: calc(33% - 20px); bottom: 26px</code></li>
                    <li>Light 3: <code>left: calc(66% - 20px); bottom: 52px</code></li>
                    <li>Light 4: <code>right: 0; bottom: 78px</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Readable Text</strong>: Maintained 82px light diameter and 11px font-size so pundex names remain legible while fitting on screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Compact Title</strong>: Reduced "POWER UP!" text to 34px with 18px bottom margin for mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>Viewport Constraint</strong>: Set meter width to <code>min(360px, 90vw)</code> to ensure overlay fits on narrow devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pathway Selector - Header Spacing Refinement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title Area Margins</strong>: Reduced title area <code>margin-top</code> to 10px and removed <code>padding-bottom</code> to minimize gap between green line and "SELECT A WORLD" text.</li>
            <li><strong>Button Grid Offset</strong>: Used <code>margin: -94px auto 10px</code> with large internal <code>padding-top: 110px</code> so only thin strip shows below title while buttons stay below header on real devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrollable Height</strong>: Adjusted <code>max-height: calc(100% + 10px)</code> to compensate for padding and ensure bottom buttons remain visible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Button Text Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Font Sizing</strong>: Set arcade button base font to 0.55em with long-text at 0.85em and compact-text at 0.75em for balanced readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Line Breaks</strong>: Changed span styling to <code>white-space: normal</code> and <code>line-height: 1.2</code> so labels like "Measurement" wrap cleanly without truncation.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Span Width</strong>: Expanded button span width to 92% to maximize text area within circular buttons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mobile-Specific Grid Spacing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FDP World Consistency</strong>: Added mobile override for FDP world button container with <code>row-gap: 24px</code> and <code>column-gap: 26px</code> to match standard world spacing.</li>
            <li><strong>Uniform Button Sizes</strong>: Applied <code>width: 130px !important</code> and <code>height: 130px !important</code> to FDP buttons on mobile so all worlds use identical sizing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real Device Testing Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top Button Visibility</strong>: Diagnosed issue where top two buttons were missing on real mobile (not in desktop emulation) due to browser UI height differences.</li>
            <li><strong>Padding-Based Solution</strong>: Switched from margin-based offset to padding-based offset with negative margin overlay to guarantee buttons start below sticky header on all devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Up Fit</strong>: Verified diagonal layout fits entirely on real mobile screens after user reported overlay was cut off in initial implementation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Files Modified</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Pathway_Selector.html</code> - Mobile container centering, button grid layout, text wrapping, header spacing, breadcrumb alignment</li>
            <li><code>progress_dashboard.html</code> - Sticky header opacity fixes, mission/world row backgrounds and outlines</li>
            <li><code>styles.css</code> - Power Up overlay mobile diagonal layout with absolute positioning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Session Fourteen: December 22-23, 2025</h2>
        <p>Major architectural migration from localStorage to Supabase for cross-device user management, plus refinements to the user creation interface and authentication system.</p>

        <h3>User Interface Refinements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Date Picker</strong>: Replaced the default date input with custom dropdown selectors for day, month, and year (ages 3-12), with proper validation and formatted display.</li>
            <li><strong>PIN Input Enhancement</strong>: Implemented 4 separate input fields for PIN entry with auto-focus, backspace navigation, and prevention of browser autofill suggestions.</li>
            <li><strong>Year Group Confirmation</strong>: Added a modal popup to confirm the calculated school year (Reception or Year 1-6) before account creation, with glowing red display of the confirmed year.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Tab Logic</strong>: Modified the page load behavior to show the New User tab by default when no users exist, switching to Quick Login only when users are present.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supabase Migration & Cross-Device Login</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PIN Field Addition</strong>: Added a <code>pin</code> TEXT column to the <code>user_profile</code> table to store user PINs for authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete LocalStorage Removal</strong>: Eliminated all localStorage dependencies, replacing them with direct Supabase queries for user creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.</li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous User Loading</strong>: Implemented async functions for fetching users from Supabase, with error handling and loading states for both Quick Login and Manage Users tabs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Device Authentication</strong>: Users can now log in from any device using their PIN, with accounts stored centrally in Supabase rather than browser-local.</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase Client Integration</strong>: Switched from ES modules to UMD Supabase client for reliable loading, with proper error handling for network issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Management Overhaul</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Remote User Listing</strong>: Quick Login now fetches and displays all users from Supabase, ordered by first name.</li>
            <li><strong>Remote Deletion</strong>: Manage Users tab performs all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) directly against Supabase, with real-time UI updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk Operations</strong>: Implemented delete selected and delete all functionality that operates on Supabase records, with confirmation dialogs and success feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic UI Population</strong>: User lists, checkboxes, and metadata (year group, ID) are generated dynamically from Supabase data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Authentication & Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PIN-Based Login</strong>: Replaced local user lookup with Supabase authentication using stored PINs.</li>
            <li><strong>Row Level Security</strong>: Verified RLS settings on the user_profile table to ensure proper access control (currently disabled for development).</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Added comprehensive error handling for network failures, invalid credentials, and database connection issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Management</strong>: Removed local session tracking since users can log in from any device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key Management</strong>: Resolved Supabase connection issues by ensuring correct anon key configuration and disabling RLS where appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Cleanup</strong>: Removed all localStorage functions (getUsers, saveUsers, setCurrentUser, getCurrentUser) and related migration code.</li>
            <li><strong>Async/Await Patterns</strong>: Updated all user operations to use modern async/await syntax for better error handling and code readability.</li>
            <li><strong>UI State Management</strong>: Implemented proper loading states and error displays for Supabase-dependent UI components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Files Modified</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>index.html</code> - Complete rewrite of user management system, Supabase integration, UI refinements for date picker and PIN input</li>
            <li><code>user-auth.js</code> - Retained for utility functions (generateUUID, getYearGroup), but removed from user storage logic</li>
            <li><code>Q_Serving_Evolution.html</code> - Added Session 14 documentation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-15" class="session">
        <h2>Session Fifteen: December 24, 2025</h2>
        <p>Focused on polishing the Supabase-powered login experience: stabilizing Manage Users layout, restoring Quick Login scrolling, and overhauling the Date of Birth inputs.</p>

        <h3>Manage Users Layout & Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sticky Action Bar</strong>: Split the tab into a sticky control header (Select All, Delete Selected, accent line) and an independently scrolling user list so actions are always visible.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Spacing</strong>: Enforced 10px gaps above/below the control bar, between users, and at the bottom of the scroll area so the last card never clips.</li>
            <li><strong>User Card Refresh</strong>: Harmonized fonts, colors, and button styles with the other tabs, added dedicated PIN buttons, and resized the delete icon to a compact bin-only button.</li>
            <li><strong>JS Rendering Cleanup</strong>: `loadManageUsers()` now renders controls into `#manageControlsRow` and user cards into `#manageUsers`, ensuring DOM elements exist before state updates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quick Login Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reliable Scrolling</strong>: Restored classic `overflow: auto` behavior with a `max-height` tied to the viewport so long user lists remain usable.</li>
            <li><strong>No Stray Controls</strong>: Ensured Manage Users controls never bleed into Quick Login by only applying the flex layout when the Manage tab is active.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Date of Birth Input Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unified Styling</strong>: Day, Month, and Year selectors now share identical geometry, placeholder colors, focus glows, and black option text.</li>
            <li><strong>Day Selector Width</strong>: Adjusted sizes so placeholder text (“Day”) is never clipped while keeping the row compact.</li>
            <li><strong>Year Typing Buffer</strong>: Rebuilt the year dropdown to capture 4-digit keyboard input via a buffer, preventing premature confirmation popups.</li>
            <li><strong>Datalist Support</strong>: Reintroduced dropdown suggestions for Year while still allowing typed entry with delayed confirmation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Validation & Modal Workflow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Impossible Date Guard</strong>: Day options dynamically enable/disable based on the selected month and year (e.g., February 31st is no longer selectable).</li>
            <li><strong>“No” Button Behavior</strong>: Rejecting the year confirmation now clears whichever DOB field was changed last, guiding users to re-enter accurate data.</li>
            <li><strong>Debounced Confirmation</strong>: Year confirmation modal only appears after a full 4-digit year is entered (or after the typing buffer delay), eliminating unwanted popups after the first digit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Files Updated</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>index.html</code> – Manage Users layout restructure, Quick Login scroll fixes, comprehensive DOB selector styling, validation, and modal logic improvements.</li>
            <li><code>Q_Serving_Evolution.html</code> – Recorded Session 15 updates.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-16" class="session">
        <h2>Session Sixteen: December 27, 2025</h2>
        <p>Locked in the split experience between Initialise mode and the standard Question Server, ensured hosted question delivery works from GitHub, and refreshed navigation tooling across every page.</p>

        <h3>Hamburger Menu Personalisation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Per-Page Menu Config</strong>: Refactored <code>UserAuth.createUserHeader()</code> so every page can pass dedicated menu items—Q_Server shows Progress / Pathway Selector / Logout, Q_Server_initialise keeps Initialisation Progress / Guidance / Logout, and Progress Dashboard mirrors the Q_Server navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Guidance Button</strong>: The Initialisation Guidance alert is now wired only where it’s needed, preventing accidental duplication of initialise-only messaging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progress Dashboard & Naming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Rename</strong>: <code>Progress_Dashboard_dynamic_levels.html</code> was renamed to <code>progress_dashboard.html</code> with every reference updated across the codebase and documentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Dashboard Menu</strong>: Added Pathway Selector navigation to the dashboard hamburger while hiding the redundant Progress button when already on the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question Hosting & Case Sensitivity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GitHub-Friendly Fetch</strong>: Updated <code>app.js</code> to load question JSON files from the lowercase <code>questions/</code> directory so the hosted site no longer 404s due to case differences between Windows and GitHub Pages.</li>
            <li><strong>User Guidance</strong>: Documented the deployment steps so missions can be tested directly from the GitHub Pages build once the JSON files are uploaded.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Progression Logic Split</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Classic Mission Rules</strong>: Restored the standard Q_Server flow to rely exclusively on the “7 correct in first 10” and rolling “7-of-10” rules—no auto power-ups for streaks and no power-downs after 15 attempts.</li>
            <li><strong>Initialise-Only Extras</strong>: Kept the 5-in-a-row promotion and 15-question power-down logic scoped to initialise mode so calibration can still fast-track or slow-track pupils as intended.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Initialise Progress Persistence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resume Ready Sessions</strong>: Fixed <code>loadUserProgress()</code> to search saved data before defaulting to the Ready tier specified by the initialise URL, allowing partially completed Ready sessions to resume when returning from <code>progress_dashboard_initialise.html</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Saves</strong>: Confirmed partial progress is written after every answer via <code>savePartialProgress()</code>, keeping initialise dashboards in sync with in-session work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pathway Selector Refinements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Menu Alignment</strong>: Ensured the selector’s hamburger only shows Progress + Logout (no initialise actions) for parity with the main quiz experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Mission Launches</strong>: Verified mission buttons still deep-link into Q_Server with the correct parameters after the navigation overhaul.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="session-17" class="session">
        <h2>Session Seventeen: December 27-28, 2025</h2>
        <p>Polished the Initialise journey end-to-end: refreshed overlays, tightened visual language, and addressed the new Supabase account-creation error.</p>

        <h3>Initialise Guidance & Mission Complete UI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guidance Overlay Refresh</strong>: Rebuilt the Initialisation Guidance popup using the beloved mission-blocker styles (card, icon header, bullet list) so it now matches the rest of the initialise experience on desktop and mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>Mission Complete Tick</strong>: Restyled the in-table completion tick to the glowing purple pill used elsewhere, then resized the badge to 26×26px so single-line mission rows no longer stretch vertically.</li>
            <li><strong>Level Complete Return Flow</strong>: Instead of building the overlay inline, <code>showInitialiseLevelCompleteOverlay()</code> now stores a payload in <code>sessionStorage</code>, redirects immediately to <code>progress_dashboard_initialise.html</code>, and that page reconstructs and auto-dismisses the overlay after 5s—eliminating the “jumpy” refresh.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Power-Up Overlay & Animation Tweaks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pill-Shaped Lights</strong>: Converted the four power-up lights into pill badges that read better on top of the celebratory background.</li>
            <li><strong>Staircase Layout</strong>: After feedback about overlapping circles, reauthored the CSS so the pills climb from bottom-left to top-right in a clear staircase on both desktop (absolute positioning) and mobile (scaled offsets).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Initialise Mission Complete Glow Card</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legacy Styling Restored</strong>: Recreated the glowing, full-width overlay that previously shipped with Question Server, including the four coloured Pundex stars (Ignition/Charging/Ready/Power Up), uppercase heading, and centered CTA button.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Stylesheet Hook-Up</strong>: Added an explicit <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code> to <code>progress_dashboard_initialise.html</code> so the overlay reuses the main CSS bundle rather than falling back to browser defaults.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Account Creation Reliability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gamertag Collision Guard</strong>: Resolved the “Account creation failed. Please try again.” Supabase error by checking for existing <code>user_profile.gamertag</code> records before inserts. Users now get a clear “Gamertag already taken” message instead of a generic failure.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="future-notes" class="session">
        <h2>Future Notes & Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Progress Storage</strong>: All mission progress (including initialise calibration) is currently stored in the browser’s localStorage via <code>UserAuth.getProgress()</code>. Changing device, switching browsers, or clearing storage will wipe this data until a cloud persistence option (e.g., Supabase) is implemented.</li>
        </ul>
